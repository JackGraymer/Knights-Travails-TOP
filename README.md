# Knights Travails TOP

Project for The Odin Project (TOP).<br>
The objective is to test algorithm and data structures knowledge and use it to build a script that will find the shortest path between two nodes. <br>

<strong>Knight Traveils</strong> is an exercise set up on a classic chess board, size of 8x8, with only our knight in it.<br> 
The knight has a function with 2 parameters, start point and end point.
Given these parameters, the function will determine the shortest path between them, print how many moves and which cells where used. <br>

  <p>Your task is to build a function <code>knightMoves</code> that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.</p>

  <p>You can think of the board as having 2-dimensional coordinates.  Your function would therefore look like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>knightMoves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]</code></li>
    <li><code>knightMoves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]</code></li>
    <li><code>knightMoves([3,3],[0,0]) == [[3,3],[1,2],[0,0]]</code></li>
  </ul>

  <div class="lesson-content__panel">

      <li>Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.</li>
      <li>Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree.  Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.</li>
      <li>Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case.  Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.</li>
      <li>Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square.  Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:</li>
    </ol>
    
    > knightMoves([3,3],[4,3]);
    => You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:
    [3,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,4]
    [4,3]
